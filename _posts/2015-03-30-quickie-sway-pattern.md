And by dynamic I mean really annoyingly and resource intensively so. Basically renders a grid of triangles and then uses some Javascript to animate the vertices. Made in a day.

Comes out looking like this.

<img class="u-max-full-width" src="{{ "/assets/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}sway_1.png">

And this

<img class="u-max-full-width" src="{{ "/assets/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}sway_2.png">

Live version [here]({{ site.baseurl}}/sway/)
